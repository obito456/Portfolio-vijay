        Born with a wanderlust spirit, I find solace in discovering new
        destinations, immersing myself in diverse cultures, and embracing the
        adventures that unfold along the way. With an analytical mind honed
        through software studies, I approach photography as both an art and a
        science, constantly seeking innovative perspectives and techniques to
        tell compelling stories through imagery.
